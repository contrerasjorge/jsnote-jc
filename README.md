# jsnote-jc

A jupyter notebook based markdown and javascript editor. You can import packages from npm (technically unpkg) directly in the editor. Your code is also evaluated in real time. The editor is built with typescript, react, redux, esbuild. You can try it yourself by running npx jsnote-js serve with node 14.
